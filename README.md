# Detecting Roads in Aerial Images using Deep Neural Networks

We implement a classifier following a U-Net architecture that outperforms more basic approaches and segments unseen data with high accuracy. Our model was trained using the Pytorch framework on Google's Colab infrastructure. 

## Contents

- The [src](src) folder contains all our models along with helpers for metric and loss functions.
- The [notebooks](notebooks) folder contains interactive `jupyter` notebooks that we used to train our model.
 
## Setup

The following is a list of dependencies used in this study. You can install them using either `pip` or `anaconda`:
- [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) 
- [Pytorch learning rate finder](https://github.com/davidtvs/pytorch-lr-finder)
- Matplotlib 
- Numpy 

To run the various notebooks, you will need `jupyter lab` (or `notebook`).
